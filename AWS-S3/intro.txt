AWS S3 -> Simple Storage Service
    Object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data.
Use Cases:
    File uploads, data lakes, static website hosting, backups.

To use S3 effectively at scale, you must understand it is 'not a filesystem;' it is a 'distributed key-value store with eventual consistency' (historically) turned strong consistency.
    - Strong Consistency:
        Since Dec 2020, S3 is strongly consistent for all PUTs and DELETEs. You can write an object immediately read it or list it.
            Gotcha: This applies to the object level. Bucket configurations (ACLs, Policy changes) are still eventually consistent.
